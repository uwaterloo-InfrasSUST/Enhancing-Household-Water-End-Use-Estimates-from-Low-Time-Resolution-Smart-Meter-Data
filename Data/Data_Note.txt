This sample dataset includes self-reported water use activities from one household (Household water use pattern from pre-survey.csv), along with several days of hourly smart meter data (Household hourly water use data samples.csv). This information is sufficient to test our approach for initializing the stochastic discrete event model and applying Bayesian inference using the household's hourly consumption data.
To further evaluate and expand this framework, we encourage you to explore additional datasets provided by the DAIAD project, available at https://github.com/DAIAD.
